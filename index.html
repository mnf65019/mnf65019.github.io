	<p style="font size:24px;"> University of Georgia has a club rowing team. In the beginning of the fall semester, the team hosts conditiong and try-outs to allow new members an opportunity to join the team. Anyone interested is encouraged to come to conditioning for a week that includes workouts of extensive running and endurance buildups. One of the conditioning days allows for a break from the workouts and an adventure to see the boathouse and lake, where most of the season is spent.</p>
	<p> After becoming a member of the team, they will have three water practices where they along with 7 other teammaters and a coxswain (the person who helps keep the rythm of the boat by saying commands and steers the boat) take a boat onto the water and practice with guidance from the coach. Along with the three water practices, they also have two land practices that they are able to do on their own time. The land practices consist of workouts like erging, biking, and running. The purpose of the workouts is to help build endurance and muscules needed for rowing. All of these practices are to help prepare the members for regattas (or "races").</h4></p>
